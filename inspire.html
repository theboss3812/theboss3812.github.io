        <h2>My Personal Hero</h2>
        <p>A hero to me is someone who shows the courage and openess that I wish to show in my every day life. My personal hero is a woman called Chappell Roan.</p>
        <p>She has currently blown up in the music industry and has inspired many to follow their dreams. Something I like about her is that she is unapolegetically herself as an out Lesbian woman. </p>
