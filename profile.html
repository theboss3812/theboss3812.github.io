  <p>Hello, I am Abby McGinnis and I am a senior at the University of Northern Colorado persuing a degree in Computer Information Systems. I love all things nerdy, especially Doctor Who or Lord of the Rings.
  When I am not at school I am at work as a Student Network Engineer for the university. In my free time I love to go to live concerts and hang out with firends.</p>
